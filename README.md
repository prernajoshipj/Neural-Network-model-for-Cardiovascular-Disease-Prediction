# Neural-Network-model-for-Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction
Developed a Neural Network model for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction, trained on 70,000 health records, achieving 73.55% accuracy. Preprocessed data with one-hot encoding, standardization, and PCA for dimensionality reduction. Built a Sequential model with Dense layers, trained using RMSprop optimizer.
